# Application of the Classification Server

The Classification Server will be a component of Phaidra, the Digital Asset Management Platform with long-term archiving functionality developed by the University of Vienna.

Phaidra is an acronym for Permanent Hosting, Archiving and Indexing of Digital Resources and Assets. Phaidra is implemented at several local Austrian institutions and also internationally, including universities in Serbia, Montenegro and Italy. Phaidra provides academic, research- and management staff the possibility to archive objects and to permanently secure them, to create them systematically, to supplement them with metadata, as well as to archive objects for an unlimited period of time - and provides world-wide access to them.

We are going to apply the Classification Server during the ingestion phase, when the user of Phaidra uploads new items to the archiving system and wants to assign metadata to it from controlled vocabularies, and also when the user searches for items supplying terms from existing classifications. We also need it for resolving the terms saved in objects when displaying them.
