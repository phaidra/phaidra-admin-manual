# Fedora

Fedora is an acronym that means Flexible Extensible Digital Object Repository Architecture. Fedora is a robust, modular, open source repository system for the management and dissemination of digital content. It is especially suited for digital libraries and archives, both for access and preservation. It is also used to provide specialized access to very large and complex digital collections of historic and cultural materials as well as scientific data. Fedora has a worldwide installed user base that includes academic and cultural heritage organizations, universities, research institutions, university libraries, national libraries, and government agencies. 

### Metadata design patterns in Fedora 4

Fedora 4 presents metadata designers with radical new capabilities, as well as new responsibilities.

#### Blank nodes

Fedora 4 offers very limited support for the use of blank nodes in metadata. While no response from the API will contain blank nodes, it is possible to send a request to the API containing blank nodes.

#### Ordering

RDF, as a graph, is inherently unordered, and this can lead to difficulty when forms of description that presuppose ordering are translated into it. The Fedora community is trying several methods for constructing order in a graph.
